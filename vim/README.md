# Vim
This setup is mainly for Debian and cleaned up my old way to backup the whole .vim folder.  

apt install vim-latexsuite

vim-addons install latex-suite

apt install vim-julia

vim-addons install vim-julia

create folder: 

.vim/pack/vendor/start

Then use git to clone packages there, my current list:
- bufexplorer
- nerdcommenter
- vim-colorschemes
